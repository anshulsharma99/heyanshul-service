# Hey Anshul

This repository contains the source for my personal brand website hosted at [www.heyanshul.in](https://www.heyanshul.in/).

The page is built with HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript. All text on the site is loaded from `data.json`, so you can update details such as the tagline or contact email without editing the code. Just modify the JSON file and reload the page.

To view the site locally, open `index.html` in a browser. GitHub Pages automatically serves the page from the `main` branch.
