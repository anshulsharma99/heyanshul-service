# Hey Anshul

This repository contains a simple data-driven personal website for a software developer engineer in test.

The site is designed to look clean and minimal, similar to Apple's style. Blog posts are loaded dynamically from `posts.json` using JavaScript.

All posts are listed on a dedicated [blog.html](blog.html) page as well as the blog section of the homepage.

## Adding a Blog Post

1. Open `posts.json`.
2. Add a new entry to the array with a `title`, `date`, and `content`.
3. Commit and push your changes. The post will automatically appear on the site.
