# Dummy Blog: Hello Structure

This is a placeholder blog post to verify that root-level markdown files inside `blogs/` are rendered on the website.

## Why this exists

- Confirms the site picks up `.md` files at the root of `blogs/`.
- Keeps the same folder/file-driven structure used by the existing blog index generator.

You can replace this file with your real content anytime.
